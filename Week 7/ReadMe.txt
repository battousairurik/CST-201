Title: Maze Project, Milestone 6 and Milestone 7

Description: This week i have created a few new classes, The Graph class which now acts like the MazeSquare class used to. The Vertex and Neighbor classes which the Graph class utilizes.

For Milestone 6 I utilize Depth First Search and a stack to find paths through the graph.

For Milestone 7 I utilize Breadth First search and a queue to find paths throguh the graph.
